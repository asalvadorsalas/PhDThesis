\chapter{The \acrlong{SMlabel} of Particle Physics and beyond}

Be great to say that the lagrangian we want has to describe reality, what we want is something Lorentz invariant, Pointcar√© group?

The \acrfull{SMlabel} of particle physics~\cite{PhysRevLett.19.1264,GLASHOW1961579,RevModPhys.52.525} is the theoretical framework
that so far better describes subatomic particles and their interactions.
It is a \acrlongpl{QFT} (\acrshort{QFT}) and since its initial development in the 1960's,
the model has been overwhelmingly successful and guided many experimental achievements
including the discovery of the top quark~\cite{topsearch1995,PhysRevLett.74.2626} in 1995
and the Higgs boson at the LHC in 2012~\cite{ATLASHiggs2012,CMShiggs2012}.
Regardless of the success of the model, there are known phenomena not covered in the model
and other questions which clearly point to the need of a new theories.\\
This chapter presents an overview of the \acrshort{SMlabel} with a brief summary of the particle content as of yet without
[going] into underlying theoretical details. \textcolor{red}{Next, the description of\ldots}\\

Throughout this dissertation, natural units are used: the speed of light and the reduced Plank constant are set to unity ($c=\hbar=1$),
electric charges are expressed in units of the electron electric charge ($-e$) and masses are expressed in terms of energy (eV).
Within the theoretical developments in this chapter, the Einstein's summation convention is used by default.

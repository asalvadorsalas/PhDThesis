Introduction


\section{CERN and the Large Hadron Collider}

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a circular particle accelerator, consisting of 27 km of circumference tunnel built by the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), situated underground in the France-Swiss boarder. This tunnel contain two parallel pipes, with more than 1000 superconducting magnets and accelerating structures, where two beams of protons travel at the same time in opposite directions to collide in four different particle detectors built around the ring to record and study the interactions, as shown in the (nom de la figura).\\

\section{Beyond the Standard Model}

Beyond the \acrshort{SMlabel} (\acrshort{BSMlabel}) theories aim to extend or replace the \acrshort{SMlabel} by addessing its limitations and shortcomings. Several theories have been proposed to address some of the gaps mentioned in the previous section, and among them are the extended Higgs sectors and flavon models. Overall, \acrshort{BSMlabel} theories provide a rich landscape of new physics, and their predictions can be tested by current and future experiments.\\

\subsection{Two Higgs Doublet Model}

The Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) extends the \acrshort{SMlabel} by adding a second Higgs doublet. With two scalar Higgs doublets, the electroweak symmetry can be broken differently and the type of model can be defined depending on which fermions couple to each doublet. One of the most popular is the Type-II 2HDM, in which up-type quarks couple to one doublet while the down-type quarks and charged leptons couple to the other,

\begin{equation}
    \Phi_1\equiv H_u = 
    \begin{pmatrix} H^+_u \\ H^0_u \end{pmatrix} =
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
    \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ v_u \end{pmatrix},
    \qquad
    \Phi_2\equiv H_d = 
    \begin{pmatrix} H^-_d \\ H^0_d \end{pmatrix} =
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
    \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ v_d \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

with $v_u$ and $v_d$ being the \acrshort{VEV} of each doublet field. This scalar sector has eight initial degrees of freedom, four more than in the \acrshort{SMlabel}, yielding a total of five physical scalars instead of just the \acrshort{SMlabel} Higgs. The predicted particles are two neutral CP-even scalars $h$ and $H$ ($m_h < m_H$), one CP-odd pseudo-scalar $A$ and two charged Higgs bosons $H^\pm$. Including the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values $\tan\beta=\frac{v_u}{v_d}$, and a mixing angle $\alpha$ that diagonalises the mass matrix of the CP even states. This type of models have six free parameters: $m_h$, $m_H$, $m_A$, $m_{H^\pm}$, $\tan\beta$ and $\alpha$.

\subsection{Supersymmetry}

One of the most popular \acrshort{BSMlabel} theories is Supersymmetry (SUSY). It is a framework of theories that introduce a symmetry between the fermion and boson sector (supersymmetry), and can solve many problems in particle physics like the hierarchy problem or introduce candidates for DM. No new particles have been found so far, hence if SUSY exists, it must be broken so SUSY particles can have a different mass from the known particles.\\

The simplest realization of SUSY is the Minimal Supersymmetic~\acrshort{SMlabel} (MSSM), one of the models best studied and motivated. The model introduces the minimal amount of degrees of freedom with respect to the \acrshort{SMlabel}, with new particles and no new interactions. Every \acrshort{SMlabel} particle has an associated superpartner with different spin: the SUSY particles related to the \acrshort{SMlabel} gauge bosons are known as gauginos, the squarks are related to quarks, sleptons to leptons and Higgsinos to the Higgs bosons. The MSSM has an additional Higgs doublet to prevent anomalies from the Higgsino, therefore it is a 2HDM theory and predicts five physical scalars, as mentioned before.\\

In addition, a new quantum number is introduced, the $R$-parity,

\begin{equation}
    R=(-1)^{3(B-L)+2S}
\end{equation}

where $B$ is the baryon number, $L$ is the lepton number, and $S$ is the spin. The parity has a value of $+1$ for \acrshort{SMlabel} particles and -1 for the SUSY particles. The $R$-parity is conserved in the MSSM and, as one of the consequences, the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) is stable and has a negligible coupling with the \acrshort{SMlabel} particles making it a candidate for DM.\\

Since the discovery of the Higgs boson it is usual to interpret either of the CP-even neutral scalars ($h$ or $H$) of the theory to be the SM Higgs. One method is to work in the decoupling limit, where  all the non-standard Higgs bosons are assumed to be heavier so the $h$ scalar behaves just like the SM Higgs boson. Another method can be found comparing the \acrshort{SMlabel} Higgs couplings to the different particles. In the hMSSM model %https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05653.pdf
the couplings of the new Higgs particles to the \acrshort{SMlabel} can be easily written and compared to the \acrshort{SMlabel} Higgs couplings,

%
%\begin{equation}
%    g_{H_\text{SM}VV}\quad \rightarrow\quad H_\text{SM} = H \cos(\beta-\alpha)+h\sin(\beta-\alpha)\\
%    g_{H_\text{SM}u\bar{u}}\quad \rightarrow\quad H_\text{SM} = H \sin\alpha/\sin\beta+h\cos\alpha/\sin\beta\\
%    g_{H_\text{SM}d\bar{d}}\quad \rightarrow\quad H_\text{SM} = H \cos\alpha/\cos\beta+h\cos\alpha/\sin\beta\\
%    
%\end{equation}

with $V$ being the massive gauge bosons. Taking the limit $\cos(\beta-\alpha)\to 0$, the $h$ behaves like the \acrshort{SMlabel} Higgs. The coupling to gauge bosons is particularly important, as they arise from the gauge invariance and do not depend on the particular MSSM model. 
The alignment limit is precisely working in the limit $\cos(\beta-\alpha)\to 0$, where the $h$

the alignment limit is in which only one of the CP-even scalars couples to massive particles. %

Charged Higgs phenomenlogy (production and decay)

As discussed in Section 1.2.3 FCNC measurements, FCNC processes are heavily suppressed in the SM, yielding BR unreachable by the current accelerators. Nevertheless, it makes FCNC searches a great candidate for BSM as any proof of FCNC at the reachable sensitivity would point to a theory that introduces this type of interactions or slightly modifies the GIM mechanism.

Flavon -> types of mechanisms -> U(1) (check paper and internal note)
Flavon, prediction and decay aswell?
assuming f / lambda sm to be cabibo angle 0.23???

The ATLAS experiment [6] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [7] is a general-purpose detector that allows
for a wide range of DM searches. In the following, the focus will be entirely on the hypothesis that DM is a
weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) [8] and, more specifically, a Dirac fermion. WIMPs could in
principle interact with the SM sector in different ways. A particular strength of collider searches lies in the
fact that the high-energy collisions of SM particles could not only produce DM directly under controlled
experimental conditions but also provide access to particles mediating the interactions between DM and
the SM sector. A mediator produced in a collision could decay to DM particles, which themselves could
not be detected and would lead to missing transverse momentum (with magnitude \MET). Alternatively, a
mediator could decay back into SM particles, from which its properties could be reconstructed.
Dark matter searches at the LHC explore both avenues in the quest to solve the puzzle of DM. Invisible
mediator decays can be detected only if the mediator is produced in association with another particle,
for example from initial-state radiation that results in a hadronic jet, leading to a characteristic \MET+jet
signature [9, 10]. Visible mediator decays allow for the reconstruction of the mediator particle from
its decay products, for example in the context of resonance searches, if the mediator is produced in the
s-channel [11-15].

The above-mentioned searches are traditionally interpreted in the context of so-called simplified models of
DM, which rely on a minimal set of new particles and interactions. The most commonly used among these
simplified models postulate the existence of a single fermionic DM particle and a single mediator, which,
depending on the model, could be a vector, axial-vector, scalar, or pseudo-scalar particle [16-18]. The
models are characterised by a minimal set of free parameters, namely the masses of the DM and mediator
particles and the couplings of the mediator to the SM and dark sectors.

In this note, a more complete benchmark model is used. It provides an ultra-violet complete and
renormalisable framework for the interpretation of DM searches. It is built upon the assumption that the
SM Higgs boson is part of an extended Higgs sector with two complex Higgs doublets. This is a key
assumption in many theories extending the SM, such as supersymmetry [19]. The interaction between the
SM sector and DM in this model is mediated by a pseudoscalar particle a. Pseudoscalar mediators are not
strongly constrained by direct-detection experiments because the tree-level amplitude for the DM-nucleon
elastic scattering is suppressed by the momentum transfer in the non-relativistic limit [20]. This renders
collider searches for these processes particularly useful.

The model, referred to as Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) + pseudoscalar mediator (a), 2HDM+a, is
the simplest and currently only gauge-invariant and UV-complete extension of the simplified model with a
pseudoscalar mediator, and has been first introduced in Ref. [21]. The model is adopted as a common LHC
benchmark model by the LHC Dark Matter Working Group [22], which is a joint forum of theory groups
and the ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb collaborations. This model, unlike the simplified models described above,
predicts a wide variety of detector signatures. Among the most prominent signatures in the parameter space
explored in this note are the production of DM in association with a Higgs boson (\MET+h signatures) or
with a Z boson (\MET+Z signatures). Further signatures are related to DM production in association with
a top quark and a W boson (\MET+Wt), visible decays of the additional heavy Higgs bosons, and invisible
decays of the SM Higgs boson to DM.
A summary paper including constraints on the 2HDM+a benchmark based on a variety of dark matter
searches using 36 fb$^{-1}$ data of sqrts = 13 TeV proton-proton collisions has been previously published by the
ATLAS Collaboration [23]. Constraints on the model have also been derived by the CMS Collaboration
using the results from searches in the \MET+ h(\bbar) [24] and \MET.
